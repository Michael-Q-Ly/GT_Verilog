# Verilog, Formal Verification and Verilator Beginner

This repo is for me to review and learn new Verilog practices using safe, formal practices.

This repo is NOT intended to be a tutorial for others, either. It is purely for me, as I am using [GT LLC's tutorial](https://zipcpu.com/tutorial/)

Guidelines I will be following are:

* Using SymbiYosys for formal verification
* Using Verilator and C++ for testbenches
* ONLY using synthesizeable code

*This is a work in progress, and I will add more to the README as I dive further into this tutorial.*
